Most commonly\\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\\n *\\n * ---\\n *\\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\\n * name of the component).\\n *\\n * ---\\n *\\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\\n * component it renders, it only tracks \\\"enter\\\" and \\\"exit\\\" states for the\\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\\n *\\n * ```jsx\\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\\n *\\n * const duration = 300;\\n *\\n * const defaultStyle = {\\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\\n *   opacity: 0,\\n * }\\n *\\n * const transitionStyles = {\\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\\n * };\\n *\\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\\n *     {state => (\\n *       <div style={{\\n *         ...defaultStyle,\\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\\n *       }}>\\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\\n *       </div>\\n *     )}\\n *   </Transition>\\n * );\\n * ```\\n *\\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\\n *  - `'entering'`\\n *  - `'entered'`\\n *  - `'exiting'`\\n *  - `'exited'`\\n *\\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\\n * begins the \\\"Enter\\\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\\n * the following example (we'll use the\\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\\n *\\n * ```jsx\\n * function App() {\\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\\n *   return (\\n *     <div>\\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\\n *         {state => (\\n *           // ...\\n *         )}\\n *       </Transition>\\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\\n *         Click to Enter\\n *       </button>\\n *     </div>\\n *   );\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\\n * to `'entered'`.\\n *\\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\\n */\\n\\nvar Transition_Transition =\\n/*#__PURE__*/\\nfunction (_React$Component) {\\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\\n\\n  function Transition(props, context) {\\n    var _this;\\n\\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\\n\\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

It's built upon the\\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\\n *\\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the\\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\\n * transition state.\\n *\\n * ```jsx\\n * function App() {\\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\\n *   return (\\n *     <div>\\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\\\"my-node\\\">\\n *         <div>\\n *           {\\\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\\\"}\\n *         </div>\\n *       </CSSTransition>\\n *       <button type=\\\"button\\\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\\n *         Click to Enter\\n *       </button>\\n *     </div>\\n *   );\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\\n * _appearance_.\\n *\\n * ```css\\n * .my-node-enter {\\n *   opacity: 0;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-enter-active {\\n *   opacity: 1;\\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-exit {\\n *   opacity: 1;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-exit-active {\\n *   opacity: 0;\\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\\n *\\n * **Note**: If you're using the\\n * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)\\n * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.\\n */\\n\\n\\nvar CSSTransition_CSSTransition =\\n/*#__PURE__*/\\nfunction (_React$Component) {\\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\\n\\n  function CSSTransition() {\\n    var _this;\\n\\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\\n    }\\n\\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\\n    _this.appliedClasses = {\\n      appear: {},\\n      enter: {},\\n      exit: {}\\n    };\\n\\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\\n      _this.removeClasses(node, 'exit');\\n\\n      _this.addClass(node, appearing ?

Most commonly\\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\\n *\\n * ---\\n *\\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\\n * name of the component).\\n *\\n * ---\\n *\\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\\n * component it renders, it only tracks \\\"enter\\\" and \\\"exit\\\" states for the\\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\\n *\\n * ```jsx\\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\\n *\\n * const duration = 300;\\n *\\n * const defaultStyle = {\\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\\n *   opacity: 0,\\n * }\\n *\\n * const transitionStyles = {\\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\\n * };\\n *\\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\\n *     {state => (\\n *       <div style={{\\n *         ...defaultStyle,\\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\\n *       }}>\\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\\n *       </div>\\n *     )}\\n *   </Transition>\\n * );\\n * ```\\n *\\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\\n *  - `'entering'`\\n *  - `'entered'`\\n *  - `'exiting'`\\n *  - `'exited'`\\n *\\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\\n * begins the \\\"Enter\\\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

It's built upon the\\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\\n *\\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the\\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\\n * transition state.\\n *\\n * ```jsx\\n * function App() {\\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\\n *   return (\\n *     <div>\\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\\\"my-node\\\">\\n *         <div>\\n *           {\\\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\\\"}\\n *         </div>\\n *       </CSSTransition>\\n *       <button type=\\\"button\\\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\\n *         Click to Enter\\n *       </button>\\n *     </div>\\n *   );\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\\n * _appearance_.\\n *\\n * ```css\\n * .my-node-enter {\\n *   opacity: 0;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-enter-active {\\n *   opacity: 1;\\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-exit {\\n *   opacity: 1;\\n * }\\n * .my-node-exit-active {\\n *   opacity: 0;\\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\\n *\\n * **Note**: If you're using the\\n * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)\\n * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.\\n */\\n\\n\\nvar CSSTransition_CSSTransition =\\n/*#__PURE__*/\\nfunction (_React$Component) {\\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\\n\\n  function CSSTransition() {\\n    var _this;\\n\\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\\n    }\\n\\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\\n    _this.appliedClasses = {\\n      appear: {},\\n      enter: {},\\n      exit: {}\\n    };\\n\\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\\n      _this.removeClasses(node, 'exit');\\n\\n      _this.addClass(node, appearing ?
